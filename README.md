# ATM_machine
Write a python program to illustrate ATM Machine.

The three primary functions of this program's ATM simulator are balance check, deposit, and withdrawal. The ATM class contains three methods: check balance, deposit, and withdraw, with a starting balance of 0. The user is given options by the while loop, and if they choose one, the related action will be executed. This is a simple illustration of how Python may be used to simulate an ATM. To make it more realistic, you can add more features and capabilities.
